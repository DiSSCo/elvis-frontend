<h2>Welcome</h2>
<p>The Transnational Access programme provides funding for researchers to undertake short visits to utilise collections, staff expertise and analytical facilities at any one of the 21 SYNTHESYS+ partner institutions for the purposes of their research. There are 4 annual TA Calls during the SYNTHESYS+ project. <a href="https://www.synthesys.info/access/transnational-access.html" target="_blank">More information</a>.</p>
<p>The Virtual Access programme is a new step for the SYNTHESYS programme. It gives researchers an opportunity to propose and make the case for a collection or collection item(s) to be digitised by the holding institution for the wider benefit of the research and/or collections community. Call 2 will be the final Virtual Access Call in the SYNTHESYS+ programme. <a href="https://www.synthesys.info/access/virtual-access.html" target="_blank">More information</a>.

<h2>European loans and visits system</h2>
<p>This Access application portal is the first step towards the development of a European Loans and Visits system (ELViS). This portal will be further developed to support applications for Virtual Access (digitisation), Transnational Access (visits) and loans, and to track their outcomes. After SYNTHESYS+, ELViS will be managed by the <a href="https://www.dissco.eu/" target="_blank">DiSSCo project</a>.</p>`;
